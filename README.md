# GCP-Sample-Application
This application aims to use basic features of Google Cloud Platform(like Google Cloud Storage, Google Datastore, etc.) through Java web Applications.

This application is deployed on Google App Engine.

Aim:
Create a simple JSP page with Upload functionality.

Upload an Excel file with columns(FirstName, LastName, Username, Age, Password) for the user registration table.
Read the Excel file and create user records in Google Datastore. For each row in the Excel data sheet, read the user registration data and create user records in a Datastore table, Users. Any user with the credentials from Excel will be able to log into to the application.
I will keep adding various other functionalities of the Google Cloud platform to this project.

Happy Coding !!
